        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <h4>
          Design Process The design process for this project followed a
          structured approach, starting from understanding the user needs,
          moving on to defining the user flow, and finally creating the
          wireframes. The steps involved were:

          {DesignProcess.map((item) => (
            <li key={item.id}>{item.process}</li>
          ))}
        </ol>
        <h3>1. User Research and Persona Development</h3>
        <h4>
          Objective: Understand the target audience, their pain points, and
          needs to inform the design decisions.
        </h4>
        <h4>Approach:</h4>
        <ul className={styles.short_list}>
          <li>
            Interviews: Conducted interviews with potential users from various
            backgrounds, including project managers, freelancers, small business
            owners, students, and remote workers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Surveys: Distributed surveys to gather quantitative data on user
            preferences and challenges related to task management and
            collaboration.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
          Outcome: From the research, five key user personas were developed:
        </h4>
        <ol className={styles.short_list}>
          {OutcomeOne.map((item) => (
            <li>{item.process}</li>
          ))}
        </ol>
        <h4>
          These personas provided a clear understanding of the usersâ€™ needs,
          which guided the design of the task collaboration and sharing feature.
        </h4>
        <h3>2. Defining the User Flow</h3>
        <h4>
          Objective: Create a logical and intuitive sequence of actions for
          users to collaborate on and share tasks.
        </h4>
        <h4>Approach:</h4>
        <ul className={styles.short_list}>

          {KeyConsiderations.map((item) => (
            <li>{item.process}</li>
          ))}

            <li>{item.process}</li>
          ))}
        </ol>
        <h3>3. Wireframing</h3>
        <h4>
          Objective: Create visual representations of the key screens and
          interactions based on the defined user flow.
        </h4>
        <h4>Approach:</h4>
        <ul className={styles.short_list}>
          {ApproachTwo.map((item) => (
            <li>{item.process}</li>

            <li>{item.process}</li>
          ))}
        </ol>
        <h3>4. Usability Testing and Iteration</h3>
        <h4>
          Objective: Ensure that the design is user-friendly and meets the needs
          of the target audience.
        </h4>
        <h4>Approach:</h4>

        <h4>
          Outcome: The usability testing confirmed that the design was intuitive
          and met the needs of the target audience. Users appreciated the
          simplicity of the task collaboration and sharing features and found
          the real-time collaboration tools particularly useful.{" "}
